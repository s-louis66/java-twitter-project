# java-twitter-project
Our biggest Java project we had to make for class with the help of each other. It is based on social media (Twitter)
with basic features like tweeting, following people, hashtags, log ins and a few other stuff,
and also, made with some other tools including maven, spring boot and tomcat to host it locally.
Also used some SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
